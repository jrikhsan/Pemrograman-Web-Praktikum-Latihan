<h1>text formatting</h1>
<p>This text is styled with some of the text formatting properties. The heading uses the text-align, text-transform, and color properties.
The paragraph is indented, aligned, and the space between characters is specified. The underline is removed from this colored
<a target="_blank" href="tryitaeac.html?filename=trycss_text">"Try it yourself"</a> link.</p>

<h1>Heading 1 (center)</h1>
<h2>Heading 2 (left)</h2>
<h3>Heading 3 (right)</h3>

<p>The three headings above are aligned center, left and right.</p>

<h1>Example text-align: justify;</h1>

<p>The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and magazines).</p>

<div>
In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
